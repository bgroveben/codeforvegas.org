Code for Vegas is a local Code for America code brigade group. Essentially, we are a group of volunteers who meet regularly to collaborate with government on technology, data, policy and design projects that strengthen our community.

Code for America was founded to build governments by the people, for the people, for the 21st century. We use the power of modern web technologies and network design principles to extend and strengthen the way citizens participate in their government.
