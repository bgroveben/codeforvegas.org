#CodeForVegas.org

Hi possible Code for Vegas member! Welcome to the source code of your website. This is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) powered site, which means it is generated by a ruby program which creates a static HTML site. You'll want to follow the directions there to get Jekyll installed. Usually it's just:

`gem install jekyll`

..assuming you have a decent version of [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) installed.

###How do I add myself to the member list?

Open up _data/members.yml and add yourself there. Just follow the format there and when the page is regenerated, you should show up on the member list!

###How do I write a blog article?

Create a new file in _posts with the format YYYY-MM-DD-my_title.html. The extension can also be .markdown if you prefer writing in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)!

Pay special attention to the 'front matter' between the pair of dashed lines for blog meta information. If you want yourself to show up as an author, make sure to add the 'author' bit and match it up with the key from your entry in members.yml in the section above this.

###How do I create a new page?

Just create a .html or .markdown file in the root directory of this site. 

###How do I publish my changes?

You just need to push what you did to the gh-pages branch. I usually do this:

`git push origin master:gh-pages`

Which pushes the content of 'master' branch to 'gh-pages'. On the back end, github runs everything though jekyll and regenrates the site dynamically.


###What if I run into problems?

Read the [Jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) or ask [Pawel](http://twitter.com/makenai).
